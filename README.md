# MyLeetCode: LeetCode Solutions in C++

This repository contains my personal solutions to various LeetCode problems, implemented in **C++**.

---

## 🚀 Features

* **Structured Solutions**: Each file corresponds to a specific LeetCode problem using proper naming conventions.
* **Optimized Code**: Focused on clean, readable, and efficient C++ implementations.
* **Wide Coverage**: Includes a variety of data structures, algorithms, BFS, DFS, and more.

---

## 🧠 File Naming Convention

Each solution is named using the following format:

```
<problem_number>_<Problem_Name>.cpp
```

### For example:

```
994_Rotting_Oranges.cpp
```

This represents LeetCode Problem 994 – Rotting Oranges.
